# 3D-Ray-Tracing
This was a program for my computer graphics course ( CGRA251 ) In this assignment I covered how ray tracing works and how different materials and lighting react to it.
This project show cases ray tacing in different enviroments from open spaces to small spaces with relfective materials. This was probably my favorite topic on my
computer graphics course as it had a lot of visual feed back making it really satisfying when completed.
